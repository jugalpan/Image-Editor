--------------------------------------------------------------
Image-Editor has been divided into 4 different project. These projects are coded in MATLAB. You may change the input images as per the one on your local drive and run the code.
All 4 projects has a UI connected to it. They are the .fig files.
Components of individual projects are as detailed below:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Project_1 : 
- Read an image and convert into grayscale
- Corrupt the image by add noise
- Noise Reduction Filter 1 - Averaging Filter
- Noise Reduction Filter 2 - Median Filter
- Convert the image to binary using Thresholding technique
- Convert the image to binary using P-Tile technique
- Convert the image to binary using Iterative technique (Industry used)
- Plot Histogram of the image
- Output a Digital image
--------------------------------------------------------------
Project_2:
- Implement Edge Detection Technique 1 - Robert's Operator
- Implement Edge Detection Technique 2 - Sobel Operator
- Implement Edge Detection Technique 3 - Kirsh Operator
- Find Laplacian of a grayscale image
- Implement a visualized version of Laplacian (educational purpose)
- Implement Component Labeling Algorithm and find individual components and the area (average size) of the component
--------------------------------------------------------------
Project_3:
- Resize the input image
- Implement pyramid structure for image with reducing the resolution:
	1. Averaging technique
	2. Alternating technique
- Smoothening Filters on very low resolution images
--------------------------------------------------------------
Project_4
- Implement steganography on a noisy image
	1: Encode text in the image
	2: Decode text from the steganographic image
